# rust-turret-3d-print

You have all the STL files required for 3D printing the parts. I will also provide the Arduino code separately.

Electrical Components Needed for the Working Turret:
1 × Servo motor
1 × Battery or power source
1 × Arduino board
1 × Laser module

Connectors and wires as needed

3D Printed Parts Required:
1 × Barrel body – base.stl
1 × Rotating shaft – servofinal60.stl or support_weapon_noservo.stl
1 × AK gun – ak2.stl
1 × Gun support – soport.stl
1 × Gun shield – weapon_cover.stl
1 × Camera – camara.stl
1 × Camera shield – soport_camara.stl
3 × Legs – legs.stl
3 × Half-bushing pairs – supports_legs.stl
